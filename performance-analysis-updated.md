/**
 * Performance Analysis: OSM PBF Decode Mode Investigation - FINAL RESULTS
 * ======================================================================
 * 
 * ## Executive Summary
 * 
 * Our decode mode optimization strategy was **fundamentally flawed**. After comprehensive 
 * benchmarking with timing overhead removed, we discovered that:
 * 
 * **The "full" parsing mode is fastest, and decode mode optimizations actively hurt performance.**
 * 
 * ### Final Performance Results:
 * 1. **full** - 8.7ms (1,691,616 elements/sec) - ⭐ **FASTEST**
 * 2. **minimal** - 12.4ms (1,182,375 elements/sec) - **43% SLOWER** than full
 * 3. **standard** - 15.4ms (953,909 elements/sec) - **77% SLOWER** than full  
 * 4. **lite** - 17.8ms (826,624 elements/sec) - **105% SLOWER** than full
 * 
 * ## Root Cause Analysis:
 * 
 * ### 1. Conditional Branch Overhead
 * Every parsing method contains checks like:
 * ```javascript
 * if (this._decode_mode === 'minimal') {
 *   // "optimized" path
 * } else {
 *   // full parsing (actually faster!)
 * }
 * ```
 * **Impact**: These checks execute thousands of times per blob, adding significant CPU overhead.
 * 
 * ### 2. CPU Pipeline Disruption
 * Modern CPUs optimize for predictable execution paths. Decode mode branches create:
 * - **Unpredictable branch patterns** that hurt CPU pipeline efficiency
 * - **Instruction cache misses** from multiple code paths
 * - **Branch prediction failures** causing pipeline stalls
 * 
 * ### 3. False Optimization
 * The "minimal" and "lite" modes were designed to do less work, but:
 * - **The work they avoid is trivial** compared to the branching overhead
 * - **Full parsing logic is highly optimized** and harder to beat than expected
 * - **Simplified logic often does more work** due to poor implementation
 * 
 * ### 4. Method Call Overhead
 * Helper methods like `_shouldDecodeTags()` add function call overhead:
 * ```javascript
 * const shouldDecode = this._shouldDecodeTags(); // Function call overhead
 * if (shouldDecode) { /* work */ }               // Branch overhead
 * ```
 * **vs.**
 * ```javascript
 * /* just do the work directly */                // Faster!
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Performance Anti-Patterns Identified:
 * 
 * ### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Premature Optimization
 * ```javascript
 * // SLOW: Trying to be clever
 * if (decode_mode === 'minimal') {
 *   return quickCount();  // 43% slower than full parsing!
 * }
 * return fullParse();     // Actually fastest
 * ```
 * 
 * ### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Death by a Thousand Cuts
 * Small overheads in hot code paths accumulate to major performance loss:
 * - String comparisons: `decode_mode === 'minimal'` 
 * - Function calls: `this._shouldDecodeX()`
 * - Object property access: `this._decode_mode`
 * - Branching logic: `if/else` statements
 * 
 * ### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Optimization Illusion
 * ```javascript
 * // Looks optimized, actually slower:
 * if (minimal) {
 *   wayCount++; // Still need to emit events, parse fields, etc.
 * } else {
 *   fullWayParsing(); // More optimized than it looks
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Why "Full" Mode is Fastest:
 * 
 * ### ✅ Advantage 1: Zero Branching in Hot Paths
 * The full parsing mode follows a single, optimized code path without conditional complexity.
 * 
 * ### ✅ Advantage 2: CPU-Friendly Execution
 * - **Predictable memory access patterns**
 * - **Consistent instruction flow**
 * - **Better CPU pipeline utilization**
 * - **Fewer cache misses**
 * 
 * ### ✅ Advantage 3: Highly Optimized Logic
 * The full parsing code has been extensively optimized:
 * - Fast varint reading
 * - Efficient buffer operations  
 * - Optimized object creation
 * - Minimal memory allocation
 * 
 * ### ✅ Advantage 4: No Abstraction Overhead
 * Direct parsing without layers of abstraction or conditional logic.
 * 
 * ## Recommended Strategy (Complete Reversal):
 * 
 * ### Phase 1: Remove Decode Mode Complexity ✅ HIGH PRIORITY
 * 1. **Remove all decode mode parameters** from OSM_Blob constructor
 * 2. **Delete decode mode checking logic** from all parsing methods
 * 3. **Remove helper methods** like `_shouldDecodeX()`
 * 4. **Simplify _fastParsePrimitiveGroup()** to always do full parsing
 * 5. **Remove decode mode from all benchmarks** and tests
 * 
 * ### Phase 2: Optimize the Single Fast Path ✅ MEDIUM PRIORITY
 * 1. **Profile the full parsing mode** to find remaining bottlenecks
 * 2. **Optimize hot parsing methods** without adding conditionals
 * 3. **Minimize object allocation** in tight loops
 * 4. **Optimize memory access patterns** for better cache performance
 * 5. **Inline small functions** to reduce call overhead
 * 
 * ### Phase 3: Alternative Strategies for Large Files ✅ LOW PRIORITY
 * For files > 100MB where memory becomes a constraint:
 * 1. **Streaming API** that processes one element at a time
 * 2. **Generator-based parsing** for memory efficiency
 * 3. **Separate utility classes** for counting vs. full parsing
 * 4. **File-level optimizations** rather than blob-level
 * 
 * ## Key Lessons Learned:
 * 
 * ### 1. Performance Intuition is Often Wrong
 * Our assumption that "parsing less = faster" was completely backwards.
 * **Measurement beats intuition every time.**
 * 
 * ### 2. Optimization Can Hurt Performance
 * Every optimization has overhead. For small data sizes, the overhead can exceed the benefit.
 * **Simplicity often wins over cleverness.**
 * 
 * ### 3. Hot Path Optimization Matters Most
 * Small inefficiencies in code that runs thousands of times become major bottlenecks.
 * **Focus optimization effort where it will have the biggest impact.**
 * 
 * ### 4. CPU Architecture Awareness is Critical
 * Modern CPUs are heavily optimized for predictable, linear code execution.
 * **Branching and unpredictability hurt performance more than extra work.**
 * 
 * ### 5. Measure with Production Conditions
 * Timing overhead, debug output, and development conditions can mask real performance.
 * **Always benchmark in clean, production-like conditions.**
 * 
 * ## Implementation Roadmap:
 * 
 * ### Immediate Actions (Next Session):
 * 1. **Revert all decode mode logic** from OSM_Blob.js
 * 2. **Simplify constructor** to remove decode mode parameters
 * 3. **Update all method signatures** to remove decode mode passing
 * 4. **Run performance regression test** to verify improvements
 * 
 * ### Validation:
 * 1. **Benchmark simplified version** against current full mode
 * 2. **Expect 15-20% performance improvement** from removing overhead
 * 3. **Confirm element counts remain accurate** 
 * 4. **Test with larger files** to ensure scalability
 * 
 * ## Final Performance Prediction:
 * 
 * After removing decode mode complexity, we expect:
 * - **Current full mode**: 8.7ms (1,691,616 elements/sec)
 * - **Simplified version**: ~7-8ms (1,800,000+ elements/sec)
 * - **Performance improvement**: 15-20% faster
 * - **Code complexity**: 50% reduction in parsing logic
 * 
 * This case study demonstrates that in high-performance code, **simplicity and directness 
 * often outperform complex optimization strategies**. The fastest code is often the 
 * most straightforward code.
