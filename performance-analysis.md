# Performance Analysis and Optimization Plan

Based on the benchmark timing output, here are the key findings and optimization opportunities:

## Key Findings from Timing Analysis

### 1. Way Parsing Performance Issues (Blob 4 - 471 Ways)
- **Minimal mode**: 135.3ms total (133.5ms in primitive groups)
- **Lite mode**: 120.4ms total (118.4ms in primitive groups) 
- **Standard mode**: 123.7ms total (122.0ms in primitive groups)
- **Full mode**: 112.1ms total (110.6ms in primitive groups)

**Issue**: Individual way parsing times vary dramatically:
- Fast ways: 0.001-0.004ms each
- Slow ways: 0.010-0.050ms each  
- Outliers: Up to 1.313ms for a single way in full mode
- Many ways taking 0.010-0.030ms when they should be faster

### 2. Dense Node Performance (Blobs 2 & 3)
**Blob 3 (6,214 nodes)**:
- Arrays parsing: ~2ms (consistent across modes)
- Emission: 0.5ms (minimal) → 2.7ms (lite) → 4.2ms (standard) → 0.7ms (full)

**Blob 2 (8,000 nodes)**:
- Arrays parsing: ~2-4ms
- Emission: 0.1ms (minimal) → 8.1ms (lite) → 2.5ms (standard) → 0.4ms (full)

**Issue**: Node emission times are inconsistent and sometimes very high

### 3. String Table Performance
- Construction time: 0.01ms-0.84ms (acceptable)
- Size varies: 1-334 strings
- No major bottlenecks identified here

### 4. Relation Parsing (Blob 5 - 28 Relations)
- Individual relations: 0.006-0.390ms each
- Generally consistent performance
- No major optimization needed

## Top Optimization Priorities

### Priority 1: Way Parsing Optimization
**Problem**: Highly variable way parsing times with many slow outliers

**Root Causes**:
1. Inefficient varint reading in way node references
2. Object creation overhead for way data structures
3. Possible string lookups for way tags
4. Buffer position tracking inefficiencies

**Solutions**:
- Pre-allocate arrays for way node references
- Optimize varint reading with lookup tables
- Cache string table references
- Reduce object creation in tight loops

### Priority 2: Dense Node Emission Optimization  
**Problem**: Node emission times vary wildly between modes

**Root Causes**:
1. Object creation for each node in higher decode modes
2. Coordinate delta decoding overhead
3. Tag processing inefficiencies

**Solutions**:
- Use object pooling for node instances
- Optimize coordinate delta calculations
- Lazy tag evaluation
- Batch processing for coordinate arrays

### Priority 3: Memory Management
**Problem**: Garbage collection pressure from object creation

**Solutions**:
- Implement object pools for nodes, ways, relations
- Reuse buffer slices instead of creating new ones
- Use typed arrays where possible
- Minimize temporary object creation

### Priority 4: Varint Reading Optimization
**Problem**: Varint reading is called millions of times

**Solutions**:
- Implement lookup table for small varints (0-127)
- Unroll varint reading loops
- Use bit operations instead of multiplication
- Cache frequently read values

## Specific Code Areas to Optimize

### 1. `_fastParseWay` method
- Current: Each way takes 0.001-1.3ms
- Target: Consistent 0.001-0.005ms per way
- Focus: Node reference array building, tag processing

### 2. `_fastParseDenseNodes` emission
- Current: 0.1-8.1ms for 6K-8K nodes
- Target: <2ms consistently  
- Focus: Object creation, coordinate processing

### 3. Varint reading functions
- Current: Called millions of times per blob
- Target: 50% performance improvement
- Focus: Hot path optimization, lookup tables

### 4. Buffer management
- Current: Many small buffer slices created
- Target: Reuse buffer objects
- Focus: Memory allocation reduction
